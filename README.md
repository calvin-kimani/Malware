# Malware
### What is malware?
Malware refers to malicious software designed to infiltrate or damage computer systems, networks, or devices. The term "malware" is derived from the combination of "malicious" and "software. It is a broad term that encompasses various types of harmful software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, adware, and spyware.

### When was the first known instance of Malware seen?
The first known instance of malware, the "Creeper" program, was developed by Bob Thomas in 1971. It ran on the TENEX operating system and spread across interconnected computers. Creeper was not created with malicious intent but was rather an experiment to demonstrate the concept of self-replicating programs.

When Creeper infected a system, it displayed the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" on the computer's display. Although it did not cause significant harm, it served as a precursor to later, more malicious forms of malware.

In response to Creeper, Ray Tomlinson developed a program called "Reaper" in 1972. Reaper was designed to detect and remove instances of the Creeper program from infected systems. It can be considered the first antivirus program, as it aimed to counter the effects of malware.

## Types of Malware

There are various types of malware that can pose threats to computer systems, networks, and devices. Here are some common types of malware:
1. Viruses: Viruses are programs that infect files or software by attaching themselves to them. When infected files are executed, the virus activates and spreads to other files, often through shared drives or network connections. Viruses can corrupt or delete data, disrupt system operations, and replicate themselves to further propagate.

2. Worms: Worms are self-replicating malware that spread across networks without requiring user interaction. They exploit security vulnerabilities in operating systems, network protocols, or software to infect other systems. Worms can consume network bandwidth, overload servers, and open backdoors for additional malware.

3. Trojans: Named after the deceptive Trojan horse from Greek mythology, Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software or files to trick users into installing or executing them. Once inside a system, Trojans can perform various malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, providing remote access to attackers, or creating botnets.

4. Ransomware: Ransomware is a particularly damaging type of malware that encrypts files or locks a victim's system, rendering it inaccessible until a ransom is paid. It often employs strong encryption algorithms, making file recovery difficult without the decryption key. Ransomware attacks can cause significant data loss and financial harm.

5. Spyware: Spyware is designed to collect information about a user's activities without their knowledge or consent. It can monitor keystrokes, capture passwords, record browsing habits, and gather sensitive data. The stolen information is typically sent to attackers who exploit it for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or financial fraud.

6. Adware: Adware is malware that displays unwanted advertisements on infected systems. It often comes bundled with legitimate software or is installed unknowingly by users. Adware generates revenue for attackers by displaying intrusive ads, redirecting web browsers, modifying search results, or collecting user data for targeted advertising.

7. Botnets: Botnets are networks of compromised computers, known as bots or zombies, controlled by a central command-and-control (C&C) server. Attackers use botnets for various purposes, including launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spreading malware, distributing spam emails, or mining cryptocurrencies using the combined processing power of the infected systems.

8. Rootkits: Rootkits are stealthy malware that gain unauthorized access to a computer system at the root level, which is the highest level of privilege. Rootkits are challenging to detect and remove since they hide their presence and alter system functions. They often provide remote control and allow attackers to maintain persistence on compromised systems.

## How does malware get into computers?
Malware can find its way into computers through various means. Here are some common methods used by attackers to deliver malware:

1. Email attachments: Malicious attachments in email messages are a common vector for malware distribution. Users may unknowingly download and execute malware when opening an infected attachment. Attackers often use social engineering techniques to trick recipients into opening these attachments.

2. Phishing emails and websites: Phishing emails and fraudulent websites attempt to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details. These emails or websites may contain links that lead to malware-infected downloads or exploit kits designed to compromise vulnerable systems.

3.  Malicious downloads: Users may inadvertently download malware-infected files from untrustworthy websites, peer-to-peer networks, or file-sharing platforms. These files can be disguised as legitimate software, cracked programs, or media files.

4.  Drive-by downloads: Drive-by downloads occur when visiting compromised websites or clicking on malicious advertisements. These websites or ads exploit vulnerabilities in the web browser or its plugins to silently download and install malware without the user's knowledge or consent.

5. Software vulnerabilities: Exploiting vulnerabilities in software is a common technique used to deliver malware. Attackers take advantage of unpatched or outdated software to infiltrate systems. This highlights the importance of regularly updating operating systems, applications, and plugins with the latest security patches.

6. Removable media: Malware can be spread through infected USB drives, external hard disks, or other removable media. When users connect infected devices to their computers, the malware can automatically execute or prompt the user to run a malicious file.

7. Social engineering: Attackers often employ social engineering techniques to manipulate users into taking actions that compromise their systems. This can involve enticing users to click on malicious links, download infected files, or disclose sensitive information through tactics like fake tech support calls or deceptive messages.

8. Malvertising: Malicious advertisements, or malvertising, can be displayed on legitimate websites. These ads may contain hidden code that redirects users to websites hosting malware or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins.
